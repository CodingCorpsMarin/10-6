We're going to write a function that takes an array of words/phrases and returns the longest one.
For example, if we had an array ["long", "longer", "longest"], our function would return "longest".

Begin by declaring our function

function longestWord(arr) {
  // Initiate a variable that will hold the length of the longest word
  var longestWord = "";
  // Create the FOR loop
  for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if(arr[i].length > longestWord.length) { // If arr[i].length is greater than the word it is compared with...
      longestWord = arr[i]; // ... then it becomes the new longestWord
    }
  }
  return longestWord
}

Test it out!

Take two objects and check to see if they share at least one key-value pair
Loop through the two objects and check their keys and values
If anything matches, return true, else, return false
For example, if we had {name: "Steven", age: 54} and {name: "Tamir", age: 54}, the function would return true, because at least 
one key-value pair matches between the two objects.

Begin by declaring our function

function matchObjects(object1, object2) {
  // Create FOR loop
  for (var key in object1) { // looping through each key in this key-value pair
		if (object2[key] == object1[key]) { // comparing keys
			return true; // if condition is met, true
		}
	}
	  return false; // else, false
}

Test it out! 
var boy = {name: 'Jimmy', age: 26}
var girl = {name: 'Alice', age: 26}
var dog = {name: 'Rover', age: 7}
console.log("Do Jimmy and Alice share something in common? " + matchObjects(boy, girl)) // true
