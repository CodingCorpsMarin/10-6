In a new directory, create a file called data_structures.js

Study up on arrays
https://repl.it/CA1g

In your new file, declare two separate arrays:
-an array of four colors ("blue", for instance, though you're welcome to get crazy with 
something like "iridescent blue/green with silver sparkles")
-an array of four names that you might give a horse ("Ed" is always a solid choice to start with)
Write code that adds another color to the colors array and another name to the names array

Study up on hashes

We need to assign colors to horses. In data_structures.js, add code that will use your two arrays to create an object. 
The keys of your object should be horse names, and the values should be colors. Your solution should be something that would work for
any number of colors/horses, as long as the two arrays are the same length. 

Study up on constructors (they're like classes for Ruby)
https://repl.it/CA4q/2

 At the bottom of your data_structures.js file, write a constructor function for a car. 
 Give it a few different properties of various data types, including at least one function.
 Demonstrate that your function works by creating a few cars with it.
