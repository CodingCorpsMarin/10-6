JS data structures include: Arrays, Linked Lists, Sets, etc
In JS, Arrays are implemented as Objects. Keys are numerical values at their respective indices. They operate in the same way as arrays in Ruby.
Common Array operations: pop(), push(), indexOf()
push() appends a new element to the end of an array
pop() removes the last element of an array
indexOf() returns the index position of a named element
These should also be familiar to you: map(), and reduce()
map() produces a new array, reduce() applies certain logic to an array and boils it down to a single value
Linked Lists are the JS equivalent of hashes
Sets are arrays except every element in a Set must be unique


Applications
Work with and be comfortable in JS data structures
Practice algorithms in JS for potential technical interviews
